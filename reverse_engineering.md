## Recommendations

### General Recommendations

* Start with something small and simple, if you get burnt out switch to
  something new. Don't tunnel vision on a massive project.
* Have a real target to reverse. Games are fun, but real software will give you
  more return in the long run.
* Google function names + MSDN when you find windows functions (or use man if
  looking at a linux program)
* Look into dollar store electronics, may be a great starting place.

### Recommended Skills

* Python
* x86 assembly language
* Portable Executables (windows software RE)
* ELF files (unix software RE)

## Tools

### Hardware Tools

TBD

### Software Tools

* Disassembler
  * IDA Pro - Most Recommended so far
  * Ghidra
  * Radare2
* Debugger
  * OllyDbg - Apparently great but only works with 32bit, so falling off in use
  * x64dbg - Most Recommended so far

## Resources

### Articles

TBD

### Books

* 'Practical Malware Analysis' - "Little outdated, but the concepts are solid"
  * Follow up book: 'Mastering Malware Analysis' - Optional, covers esoteric
    filetypes and approaches
* 'The IDA Pro Book' - if using IDA Pro
* 'Assembly Language Step-By-Step' - Good but linux focused, beginner friendly.
* After getting toes wet (reversed 3+ samples)
  * 'Practical Reverse Engineering'
  * 'Windows Internals'
